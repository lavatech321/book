		\item \textbf{Original idea for Java was not the Internet!}
		\item Java was created to be \textbf{platform-independent language} that can be embedded in various consumer electronic devices, eg: \textbf{microwave ovens and remote controls}. 
		\item The trouble with C and C++  is that they are \textbf{compiled for a specific target}. 
		\item A full C++ compiler targeted for a specific CPU is needed to compile a C++ program for different CPU.
		\item The problem is that \textbf{compilers are expensive and time-consuming to create}. 
		\item James Gosling (founder of Java) began work on a portable, platform-independent language that could be used to produce code that would run on any CPUs.
		\item This led to the creation of Java.
