		\item \textbf{Compiler: }
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A compiler is a \textbf{software program that converts source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code}, which can be executed by a computer. 
			\item The compiler performs:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Syntax analysis
				\item Semantic analysis
				\item Bytecode generation
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		
		
		\item \textbf{Interpreter:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item An interpreter is a program that reads and executes code \textbf{line-by-line}, without the need to compile the entire program beforehand.

		\item \textbf{Java Virtual Machine (JVM):}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The JVM is a virtual machine that is responsible for executing Java bytecode. 
			\item The JVM is an example of an interpreter, as it reads Java bytecode and executes it line-by-line. 
			\item The JVM performs:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Memory management
				\item Security
				\item Garbage collection
