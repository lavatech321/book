		\item A class is said to be tightly encapsulated if and only if each variable declared is \textbf{private}.
		\item Tightly encapsulate class may or may not contain corresponding getter and setter method or these methods may or may not be declared as public.
		\item Eg:
		\codeblock{
		//Below is tightly encapsulated class \\
		class A \{ \\
			\s private int a;  \\
		\} \\
		\\
		//Below is not tightly encapsulated class \\
		class B extends A \{ \\
			\s int b; \\
		\} \\
