		\item An interface is like a 100\% pure abstract class.
		\item Inside interface, every method is always abstract whether we are declaring it or not.
		\item Any service requirement specification(SRS) or any contract between client and service provider are 100\% pure abstract class, is nothing but interface.
		
		\item To declare an interface, use the interface keyword followed by the name of the interface.
		\bigskip
		\syntaxblock{
		public interface InterfaceName \{\}

		\item To implement an interface, a class must use the implements keyword followed by the name of the interface(s) it is implementing.
		\bigskip
		\syntaxblock{
		public class ClassName implements InterfaceName \{\}
		}
				
		\item A class can implement any number of interfaces solving the multiple inheritance problem.
